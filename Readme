Project:  Determine the quality of professors from their ratings.

Description:

Modern education has changed its form from scoring student according their behavior and performance in class to rating the university and professors according his/her teaching style and skills. For many students, it is important for them to understand their professor before they decide to enroll into a class. However, for many professors, the rating score and suggestions does not actually reflect their true ability to teach. As a graduate student, I am interested to learn from these rating and comments to find a good summary for each professor, according feedbacks from his/her student. This goal for this project is to build a recommendation system to predict a professor's score using data from public websites "Rate my professors" (url: http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/). We actually scraped the comments, rating score and various feedbacks for all professors listed in this site.  By learning the pattern in rating, we would like to see which aspects of teaching is emphasized for students in judging their professor. This could be used to improve the performance of instructors and help to build a flexible and comfortable relationship btw students and professors.
